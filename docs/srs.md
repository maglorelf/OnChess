**1.3. Intended Audience**

This document is intended for the following stakeholders:

* Development Team
* Project Managers
* Stakeholders
* Quality Assurance Team

**2. Overall Description**

The OnChess web application currently provides [Describe the current main functionalities of the application briefly, if known]. The proposed enhancements aim to improve user engagement and provide more value through interactive chess diagrams and exclusive content for premium users.

**2.1. Product Perspective**

The enhanced OnChess application will continue to be a web-based platform accessible through standard web browsers. The new features will seamlessly integrate with the existing functionalities.

**2.2. Product Functions**

The enhanced application will include the following new functions:

* **Dynamic Chess Diagrams:** Display interactive chess positions and allow users to analyze moves, variations, and puzzles dynamically.
* **Access Control:** Implement a system to manage user roles (Administrator, Normal User, Premium User) and control access to different parts of the application.
* **Private Section:** A dedicated section of the application accessible only to logged-in users.
* **Premium Content Access:** Premium users will have access to exclusive content such as courses and additional resources within the private section.
* **Content Generation:** Administrators will have the ability to create and manage content within the application.
* **User Management:** The application will provide functionalities for managing user accounts and their associated roles.

**2.3. User Classes and Characteristics**

The application will cater to the following user classes:

* **Anonymous Users:** Can access public areas of the application (e.g., potentially some basic chess information or public games).
* **Normal Users:** Registered users with standard access to the private section but without access to premium content or administrative functionalities.
* **Premium Users:** Registered users with access to all features available to normal users, plus exclusive premium content (courses, resources).
* **Administrators:** Users with full access to the application, including the ability to manage content, user roles, and other administrative tasks.

**2.4. Operating Environment**

The application will continue to operate in a standard web server environment, accessible through modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The specific technology stack will remain consistent with the current implementation unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints**

* The dynamic chess diagrams must be implemented using the `chessground` library (https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground).
* The access control system should be integrated within the existing application architecture.
* User management and content generation functionalities should be manageable through the application's user interface.

**3. Specific Requirements**

* **FR02:** Users shall be able to interact with the chess diagrams to move pieces (for analysis or puzzles).
* **FR03:** The diagrams should visually represent different game states and variations.
* **FR04:** The integration with `chessground` should allow for customization of the diagram's appearance (e.g., piece sets, board colors).
* **FR05:** The application should efficiently handle multiple dynamic chess diagrams on a single page.

**3.1.2. Access Control**

* **FR06:** The application shall require user registration and login for access to the private section.

* **FR13:** Premium users shall have access to all features available to normal users, plus the premium content.
* **FR14:** Administrators shall have full access to all features and functionalities, including user management and content generation.

**3.1.3. Private Section**

* **FR15:** There shall be a designated private section within the application accessible only to logged-in users.
* **FR16:** The private section shall provide a personalized experience for users.

**3.1.4. Premium Content Access**

* **FR17:** Premium users shall have access to exclusive content, such as chess courses and additional learning resources, within the private section.
* **FR18:** The system shall restrict access to premium content for users without the "Premium User" role.

**3.1.5. Content Generation (Administrator)**

* **FR19:** Administrators shall be able to create, edit, and delete content (e.g., articles, lessons, puzzles) within the application.
* **FR20:** Administrators shall be able to associate content with specific user roles (e.g., public, premium).
